<summary>ðŸŽ¯Q. Difference availability vs scalability  </summary>

- ðŸ”¹ High Availability (HA)
Definition: Ensuring your application/system is accessible and operational without downtime, even if failures occur.
AWS mechanisms:
Multi-AZ deployments (e.g., RDS Multi-AZ, S3 cross-region replication).
Load balancers across multiple Availability Zones.
Auto-recovery features (e.g., EC2 Auto Recovery).
`Exam tip`: If the question mentions minimizing downtime, fault tolerance, or disaster recovery, the answer is about high availability.
`Example`: Deploying your application across multiple AZs with ELB so if one AZ fails, traffic automatically routes to healthy instances.

- ðŸ”¹ Scalability
Definition: The ability of your application/system to handle increased load by adding more resources (scale out) or making resources bigger (scale up).
AWS mechanisms:
Auto Scaling Groups (EC2, ECS, Lambda concurrency).
DynamoDB auto-scaling (read/write capacity units).
Serverless architectures (Lambda scales automatically).
`Exam tip`: If the question mentions handling traffic spikes, growing workloads, or unpredictable demand, the answer is about scalability.
`Example`: Configuring an EC2 Auto Scaling Group to add more instances when CPU > 70%.

`High availability` = uptime, fault tolerance.
`Scalability` = ability to grow with demand.
